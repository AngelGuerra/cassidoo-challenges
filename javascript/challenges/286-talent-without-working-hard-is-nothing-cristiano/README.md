# Challenge

Spreadsheet programs often use the [A1 Reference Style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/numeric-columns-and-rows#the-a1-reference-style) to refer to columns. Given a column name in this style, return its column number.

## Example

Examples of column names to their numbers:

```
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
// etc
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28
// etc
AAA -> 703
```
