# Challenge

**Write a function that can do the 4 basic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide) on two fractions. Return the most simplified form of the result.** You can assume a non-zero denominator in the input, and donâ€™t use any built-in implementations in your language of choice, if you can!

## Example

```js
fractionMath("3/4", "add", "3/4"); // "3/2"
fractionMath("1/8", "multiply", "2/2"); // "1/8"
```
